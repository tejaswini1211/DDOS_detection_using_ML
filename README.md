# DDoS Detection Using Machine Learning 🚨💻

This project focuses on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using Machine Learning algorithms. It aims to classify network traffic as either **benign** or **DDoS attack** based on extracted network features. The model can be used in real-time monitoring systems to enhance cybersecurity.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- 📊 Dataset: Preprocessed dataset of network traffic with labeled attacks
- 🤖 ML Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier (can be extended to others)
- 🧠 Tasks: Feature selection, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model
- 📈 Evaluation: Confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy

Sample Output
Accuracy: ~98% (may vary by dataset)
